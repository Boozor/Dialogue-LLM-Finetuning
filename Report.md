# Report

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building and training a Large Language Model (LLM) using a provided text dialogue dataset. The provided JSON dataset "llm_train_text.json" was used to fine-tune a pre-trained model ("distilgpt2") from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project is divided into three main phases:
1. Data Preparation
2. Model Training
3. Evaluation and Analysis

Each phase is designed with specific goals in mind to ensure a robust and efficient training pipeline.

## 1. Data Preparation

### Steps Taken:
- **Loading the Data:**  
  The JSON dataset is loaded from the file `llm_train_text.json`. Each JSON entry represents a dialogue between two speakers (e.g., Alex and Bob).  
- **Preprocessing:**  
  The dialogues are preprocessed by concatenating the turns from each speaker with their respective labels into a single string. This formatting (e.g., "Alex: Hello... Bob: I'm fine...") preserves the conversational context while making it suitable for language modeling.  
- **Tokenization, Padding, and Truncation:**  
  The preprocessed text is then tokenized using the `distilgpt2` tokenizer. Padding and truncation are applied to guarantee uniform sequence lengths, which simplifies batching during model training.  
- **Data Splitting:**  
  The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets. This split ensures that model performance can be monitored and validated against unseen data.

### Rationale:
- **Dialogue Formatting:**  
  By maintaining speaker labels, the model learns who is speaking and is better able to generate contextually appropriate responses.  
- **Uniform Sequence Lengths:**  
  Consistency in sequence lengths (achieved via padding/truncation) is vital for leveraging GPU acceleration and simplifying the model’s batch processing.
- **Train/Validation Split:**  
  The split allows for ongoing evaluation during training, helping detect overfitting and guiding hyperparameter tuning.

## 2. Model Selection and Training

### Model & Toolkit:
- **Model Choice: "distilgpt2"**  
  We selected "distilgpt2" as it is a compact variant of GPT2, making it more feasible to fine-tune on a small dataset. Its proven language generation capabilities make it a good candidate for dialogue generation.
- **Framework:**  
  PyTorch was used because of its flexible tensor operations and integration with Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Tokenizer:**  
  The tokenizer corresponding to "distilgpt2" ensures that the text format and special tokens (like EOS and PAD) are correctly handled.

### Training Process:
- **PyTorch Training Loop:**  
  A standard training loop is implemented which includes:
  - **Forward Pass:** Processing input sequences to generate logits over the vocabulary.
  - **Loss Calculation:** Using cross-entropy loss with the pad token ignored (to avoid penalizing the model for padded values).
  - **Backpropagation & Optimizer Step:** Utilizing the AdamW optimizer, which is effective for transformer models due to its weight decay regularization.
  - **Learning Rate Scheduling:** A linear scheduler is applied to adjust the learning rate as training progresses.
  - **Checkpointing:** The model’s state is saved after each epoch. This is essential for resuming training and for evaluating the model at different stages.

### Rationale:
- **Model Efficiency:**  
  "distilgpt2" provides a balance between performance and computational requirements.
- **Optimization Strategy:**  
  AdamW and a learning rate scheduler together help in stabilizing the training process and in dealing with potential issues like exploding gradients.
- **Checkpointing:**  
  Checkpoints allow for iterative improvements and facilitate error analysis by evaluating model performance at different training stages.

## 3. Evaluation and Analysis

### Evaluation Components:
- **Validation Loss:**  
  The validation dataset is used to compute loss after each training epoch. This quantitative metric helps in understanding if the model is generalizing well to new data.
- **Sample Generation:**  
  A sample dialogue is generated using a pre-defined prompt, enabling qualitative assessment of the model’s dialogue handling capabilities.

### Analysis of Model Strengths and Weaknesses:
- **Strengths (Examples):**
  - **Coherence:**  
    Generated dialogues may show a good understanding of context, with responses that are logically consistent.
  - **Fluency:**  
    The model may produce natural-sounding, grammatically correct text.
- **Weaknesses (Examples):**
  - **Overfitting:**  
    If the validation loss continues to lag behind training loss, it indicates that the model might be overfitting, especially on a small dataset.
  - **Lack of Diversity:**  
    The generated dialogue might be too generic or repetitive if the training dataset does not contain a diverse range of examples.
  - **Context Understanding:**  
    Sometimes, the model may lose track of speakers or context in longer conversations, indicating areas for data augmentation or architecture adjustment.

### Rationale:
- **Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis:**  
  Validation loss provides an objective measure, while sample generation offers insights into practical performance and user experience.
- **Iterative Improvement:**  
  Analyzing strengths and weaknesses allows for targeted improvements, such as better data augmentation or adjustments in model hyperparameters.

## Conclusion

Overall, this approach provides a comprehensive pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation. Each stage is carefully designed to address challenges specific to dialogue modeling and to ensure that the model not only learns the training data but also generalizes to new, unseen scenarios. Continued evaluation and refinement based on both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be essential in further improving the model's performance.
